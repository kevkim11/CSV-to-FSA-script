# CSV-to-FSA-script

Main scripts here are
1) SG1_Writer.py
2) SG2_Writer.py

SG1_Writer takes a list of 5 lists that contains the values for the corresponding dyes
1) Joe
2) Flu
3) Wen
4) TMR
5) CXR
and writes the values to a .sg1 file format.

.sg1 extensions are analogous to .fsa and can be read in Applied Biosystem Genetic Analyzer Systems,
specifically GeneMarker HID.
